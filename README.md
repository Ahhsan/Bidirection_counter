# **Bidirectional Counter**

This project implements a **bidirectional people counter** using **Arduino** and **IR sensors** to track the number of people entering and leaving a room. The system is **affordable, easy to install, and reliable**, making it useful for monitoring occupancy in offices, classrooms, and event spaces.

## **How It Works**
- **IR Sensors Placement**: Two IR sensors are installed at the entrance/exit points to detect movement.
- **Bidirectional Counting**: The system differentiates between entry and exit movements based on the sequence in which the IR sensors are triggered.
- **Arduino Processing**: The microcontroller processes sensor signals and updates the count accordingly.
- **Display Output**: The total count is displayed on an **LCD screen** or sent to a connected system for real-time monitoring.

## **Key Features**
âœ… **Accurate Counting**: Differentiates entry and exit movements.  
âœ… **Low-Cost & Efficient**: Uses affordable components with minimal power consumption.  
âœ… **Easy Installation**: Simple wiring and integration with Arduino.  
âœ… **Scalability**: Can be expanded with WiFi/Bluetooth for remote monitoring.  

## **Applications**
ðŸ”¹ **Smart Room Management**: Helps regulate office, classroom, and hall occupancy.  
ðŸ”¹ **Security Systems**: Can be integrated with access control.  
ðŸ”¹ **Event Management**: Tracks foot traffic in conferences or exhibitions.  

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Integration with IoT** for remote data access.  
- **Wireless Communication** for real-time updates.  
- **Machine Learning** to improve movement detection accuracy.  

This project provides a **simple yet effective** solution for **automated occupancy monitoring**, ensuring better space utilization and management.
